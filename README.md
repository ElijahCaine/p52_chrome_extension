p52_chrome_extension
====================

A Chrome Extension to display the most recent posts from my Project 52 RSS feed.

Installation
===========

To install this app download the repo:

SSH:

	$ git clone git@github.com:ElijahCaine/py3HealthBar.git
	
HTPS:

	$ git clone https://github.com/ElijahCaine/py3HealthBar.git

Or if you'd rather steer clear of the terminal, click the "Download Zip" button on the right. Once you've downloaded it unzip the contents into the location on your Hard Drive which is most convenient for you.

Once the files are localized,

**1** Go to your Chrome Extension's Page

**2** Click the "Developer Mode" Check-Box

**3** Click the "Load unpacked extension..." button

**4** Locate the this extension's folder and enter the directory

**5** Click "open"

If everything is working properly you should have a functioning Project52 RSS Reader.

Thank you for your support!
